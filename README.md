# React-Gaming1

As a next step in the recruitment process at Gaming1 They would like to gauge my skills and creativity. To do so,
they have designed a test. Since gaming is at the heart of the business at Gaming1 they would like
for me to create a game, more specifically an adaptation of the popular game « Whack-a-mole «.

The assets of the game will be provided by them.
The concept of the game is simple. There are a total of 12 moles structured into 3 rows of each 4
moles. It’s up to the player to score points by whacking the moles when they pop up.
